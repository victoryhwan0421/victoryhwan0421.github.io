Hello, My name is SeungHwan-Lee. <br>
I'm a student of **Kangwon National University**, and my major is **Computer Engineering**.<br>
I'm interested in **Playing and Developing games**, because I've been dreaming of becoming a **Game Developer** since I was young.<br>
In addition, I'm interested in editing by recording a game that I play! <br>
I have video and image editing abilities using **Premiere Pro** and **PhotoShop**.<br>
You can see these results on my **[YouTube Channel]**.<br>
(But now I'm focusing on my studies, so I stopped running my channel and uploading videos.)<br><br>
