I've learn the Language **C**, **C++**, **Java**, and **C#**.<br>

It's not perfect, but I made a **Phone book** and a **Video rental program** with **C**,<br>
and I'm currently working on a basic program for **Flash memory**.<br>

**C++** is not as perfect as c, but I've written a few programs.<br>
First, **Phone book**<br>
Second, **Matrix operation program**<br>

In **Java**, it's all about dealing with exercises in class, rather than making a specific program.<br>

In **C#**, I recently had a group study using **Unity 3D** with three friends.<br>
There is no Output made in C# at this time.<br>
But!! I'm going to make **something awesome** soon.<br>
When the project is completed, I will open it through **here**.
