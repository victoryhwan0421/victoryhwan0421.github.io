i've learn Language **C** and **C++**.

It's not perfect, but I made a **Phone book** and a **Video rental program** with **c**, and I'm currently working on a basic program for **Flash memory**.



**C++** is not as perfect as c, but I've written a few programs.

First, **Phone book**

Second, **Matrix operation program**
