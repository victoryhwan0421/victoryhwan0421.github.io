I've learn the Language **C**, **C++**, **Java**, and **C#**.

It's not perfect, but I made a **Phone book** and a **Video rental program** with **C**, 
and I'm currently working on a basic program for **Flash memory**.


**C++** is not as perfect as c, but I've written a few programs.
First, **Phone book**
Second, **Matrix operation program**


In **Java**, it's all about dealing with exercises in class, rather than making a specific program.


In **C#**, I recently had a group study using Unity 3D with three friends.

There is no Output made in C# at this time.

But!! I'm going to make **something awesome** soon.

When the project is completed, I will open it through **here**.
