I learned the Language **C**, **C++**, **Java**, and **C#**.<br>

It's not perfect, but I made a **Phone book** and a **Video rental program** with **C**,<br>
and now I’m making a basic program for **Flash memory**.<br>

Although **C++** is not perfect like C, but I made a few programs.<br>
First is **Phone book**<br>
Second is **Matrix operation program**<br>

In the case of **Java**,  I just solved exercise question in class , rather than made a specific program<br>

Recently, I’m doing a group study using **Unity 3D** with three friends in **C#**.<br>
There is no Output made in C# just now.<br>
But!! I'm going to make **something awesome** soon.<br>
When the project is completed, I will open it through **here**.
